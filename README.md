# clj-s3-tools

Just a collection of tools I find helpful, when I work with AWS S3.

## WARNING

This library is a work in progress, so use it with caution. One design
goal of clj-s3-tools is to prevent mistakes, which lead to data loss
as much as possible. Naturally, it is still possible to delete or
overwrite important data, so be careful!
